						<h1>Hello hello everyone! My name is Margaux :)</h1>

						<h2>A brief introduction</h2>
						<p>
							Originally from Paris, I moved to Lyon before settling in Barcelona, Spain nearly a year ago.
Fluent in French, English, and Spanish, I've recently embarked on learning Japanese. In
both my professional and personal life, I am known for being serious and determined, yet
equally caring and attentive towards my family and friends. I have a wide array of interests,
but I'll delve into those later.

						<h2>I like running</h2>
						<p>
							I've been practicing running for 10 years now, and i's an incredible sport because it's easy and accessible to everyone, allowing me to enjoy it with my family and friends on weekends.
I've participated in races like a half-marathon in the city of Lyon, France. Running is one of
my passions. I also do a lot of skiing; I feel calm and rejuvenated in the mountains. Besides
that, I have a passion for music. I love attending concerts and festivals, where I can immerse
myself in the vibrant atmosphere and enjoy live performances. After that, I enjoy hanging out
in Paris with my friends.

						<h2>I love to travel</h2>
						<p>
							I'm passionate about traveling, and I've been fortunate to travel extensively. A few years
ago, I had the opportunity to tour Europe with my grandparents, which allowed me to visit
almost every country in Europe. Then, around the world, one of my favorite trips was to
Mexico. It's a country with many historical sites to visit, such as Chichen Itza, and I'm
fascinated by the history of the Maya civilization. Another favorite destination of mine is
Indonesia, particularly Bali. The local population is incredibly welcoming, making it a
memorable experience.
